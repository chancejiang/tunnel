This is a program to make generating SSH tunnels easier.  It allows
you to configure many tunnels using a .tunnelrc configuration file.
It also makes use of autossh to keep the tunnels alive.

Installation
------------
Copy tunnel into your PATH.

Write a .tunnelrc file in your home directory.  Here's an example.

Tunnels:
  Default:
    th:		  example.com	# the host to tunnel with
    autossh:      autossh    	# path to autossh, if you have it
    autossh_port: 30000         # port to use for autossh
    autossh_poll: 300           # how many seconds between trying to
                                #   reconnect

  # An example of using SSH as a SOCKS proxy
  # on localhost:1080.  IM, IRC, web browsers... lots of things
  # can talk through a SOCKS proxy
  socks:
    dynamic: 1		# tell SSH to run as a SOCKS proxy
    lp:      1080 	# local port to run on

  # Tunnel your outgoing mail connection to Gmail
  # handy for networks which block outgoing mail
  outgoing_gmail:
    lp:      587
    rh:      smtp.gmail.com

  # Tunnel to an SVN server
  svn:
    lp:      3690
    rh:      svn.example.com
